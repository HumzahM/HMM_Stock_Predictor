I wanted to do this after spending a lot of time learning about Markov Chains and HMMs in my classes.
Enter in a stock ticker, N bins (for discretizing the returns), and the number of iterations for the simulation 

V1 is a simple markov model that doesn't have anything "hidden." V2 is going to take into account the market and use the results as an observation
